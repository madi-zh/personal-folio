## Overview

Nexxiot is an IoT logistics platform where I developed AI-powered analytics features using a Python microservices architecture. The system provides intelligent data analysis capabilities for logistics operations.

## Technical Highlights

### Multi-Agent AI System
Built LangGraph-based agent orchestration system with supervisor routing, SQL generation, and report generation capabilities using AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).

### Microservices Architecture
Designed and implemented gRPC-based microservices with async communication, Protocol Buffer schemas, and gateway API layer.

### Conversation Management
Built complete conversation persistence system with multi-turn AI interaction support, message history tracking, and feedback collection.

### Authentication System
Implemented multi-issuer OIDC/JWT authentication with tenant-based access control and RBAC.

### Database Design
Architected Alembic migration system, created normalized schemas with proper indexing for multi-tenant data isolation using CockroachDB.

### Developer Tooling
Enhanced service scaffolding tooling to auto-generate protobuf definitions, Dockerfiles, and gateway routes.
